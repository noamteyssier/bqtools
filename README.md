A command-line utility for working with BINSEQ files.

## Overview

bqtools provides tools to encode, decode, manipulate, and analyze [BINSEQ](https://github.com/arcinstitute/binseq) files.
It supports all BINSEQ variants (`*.bq`, `*.cbq`, `*.vbq`) and makes use of the [`binseq`](https://crates.io/crates/binseq) library.

BINSEQ is a binary file format family designed for high-performance processing of DNA sequences.
It currently has three variants: BQ, VBQ, and CBQ.

- **BQ (\*.bq)**: Optimized for _fixed-length_ DNA sequences **without** quality scores (2bit/4bit).
- **VBQ (\*.vbq)**: Optimized for _variable-length_ DNA sequences **with optional** quality scores, headers with 2bit/4bit.
- **CBQ (\*.cbq)**: Optimized for _variable-length_ DNA sequences **with optional** quality scores, headers with 2bit + N.

All support single and paired sequences and make use of two-bit or four-bit encoding for efficient nucleotide packing using [`bitnuc`](https://crates.io/crates/bitnuc) and efficient parallel FASTX processing using [`paraseq`](https://crates.io/crates/paraseq).

For more information about BINSEQ, see our [paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1014181) where we describe the format family, applications, and benchmark against other sequencing formats.

### Description of variants

> TL;DR: `*.cbq` is the recommended format for most applications.

For most applications the BINSEQ variant of choice is `*.cbq`.
This format is lossless by default and supports variable-length sequences.
It achieves better compression than `*.vbq` and `*.bq` by using blocked-columnar compression of sequence attributes.
It can optionally exclude quality scores and headers (but they are included by default).
For an overview of the format check out the [BINSEQ docs](https://docs.rs/binseq/latest/binseq/cbq/index.html).

If your application _only requires sequences_ and has _fixed-length_ reads then `*.bq` is the best choice.
It is the _fastest_ variant but _is lossy_ by design.

> Note: `*.vbq` was originally designed for variable-length sequences with quality scores and headers, but it is now deprecated in favor of `*.cbq` which is more compressable, lossless, and has faster decoding.

## Installation

### From Cargo

bqtools can be installed using `cargo`, the Rust package manager:

```bash
cargo install bqtools
```

To install `cargo` you can follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arcinstitute/bqtools.git
cd bqtools

# Install
cargo install --path .

# Check installation
bqtools --help
```

### Feature Flags

bqtools supports the following feature flags:

- `htslib`: Enable support for reading SAM/BAM/CRAM files using the [`htslib`](https://docs.rs/rust-htslib/latest/rust_htslib/) library (default).
- `gcs`: Enable support for reading Google Cloud Storage files.
- `fuzzy`: Enable fuzzy matching in the `grep` and `split` commands using the [`sassy`](https://crates.io/crates/sassy) library

To enable fuzzy matching, `bqtools` must be compiled using a `native` target cpu:

```bash
# Install from source
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"; cargo install --path . -F fuzzy;

# Or install from crates but enforce native target cpu
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"; cargo install bqtools -F fuzzy;
```

To selectively enable/disable feature flags:

```bash
# (for fuzzy matching support sassy requires native target cpu)
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native";

# Install bqtools without htslib but with fuzzy matching
cargo install bqtools --no-default-features -F fuzzy
#
# Install bqtools without htslib but with fuzzy matching and gcs
cargo install bqtools --no-default-features -F fuzzy,gcs
```

```

### Encoding

`bqtools` accepts input from stdin or from file paths.

It will auto-determine the input format and compression status.

Convert FASTA/FASTQ files to BINSEQ:

```bash
# Encode a single file to bq
bqtools encode input.fastq -o output.bq

# Encode a single file to vbq
bqtools encode input.fastq -o output.vbq

# Encode a single file to vbq with 4bit encoding
bqtools encode input.fastq -o output.vbq -S4

# Encode a file stream to bq (auto-determine input format and compression status)
/bin/cat input.fastq.zst | bqtools encode -o output.bq

# Encode paired-end reads
bqtools encode input_R1.fastq input_R2.fastq -o output.bq

# Encode paired-end reads to vbq
bqtools encode input_R1.fastq input_R2.fastq -o output.vbq

# Encode a SAM/BAM/CRAM file to BINSEQ (detected from the extension)
bqtools encode input.bam -o output.bq

# Encode a SAM/BAM/CRAM stream (use -fb when the format can't be detected)
samtools view -b input.bam | bqtools encode -fb -o output.cbq

# Encode a paired-end CRAM file to BINSEQ (sorted by read name)
bqtools encode input.paired.cram -I -o output.vbq

# Without -o, the output is named after the input (here: input.cbq)
bqtools encode input_R1.fastq input_R2.fastq

# Write BINSEQ to stdout
bqtools encode input.fastq --pipe | ...

# Specify a policy for handling non-ATCG nucleotides (2-bit only)
bqtools encode input.fastq -o output.bq -p r  # Randomly draw A/C/G/T for each N

# Set threads for parallel processing
bqtools encode input.fastq -o output.bq -T 4

# Exclude sequence headers from the encoding (headers are never stored in .bq)
bqtools encode input.fastq -o output.vbq -H

# Encode with ARCHIVE mode (useful for genomes, cDNA libraries, and larger sequences)
# where there are common Ns, large sequence sizes, and headers are important.
# Archive mode doesn't change the BINSEQ mode, so pair it with a .vbq output (or -m vbq).
bqtools encode input.fasta -o output.vbq -A
```

The BINSEQ mode is taken from `-m/--mode`, otherwise from the `-o` extension, and defaults to `cbq`.

Available policies for handling non-ATCG nucleotides:

- `i`: Ignore sequences with non-ATCG characters
- `p`: Break on invalid sequences
- `r`: Randomly draw a nucleotide for each N (default)
- `a`: Set all Ns to A
- `c`: Set all Ns to C
- `g`: Set all Ns to G
- `t`: Set all Ns to T

> Note: These are only applied when encoding bq/vbq with 2-bit; cbq stores Ns directly.

### Encoding multiple files at the same time

Encoding FASTX files into BINSEQ is often IO-bound per-file and won't benefit much from parallelism.
However, file-level parallelism is still possible.
`bqtools` provides some options for making use of file-level parallelism by encoding into separate BINSEQ files or encoding many FASTX files into a single BINSEQ file.

`bqtools` will automatically find the pairs in the input files and respect pairing if the `--paired` flag is used.
To encode everything into a single BINSEQ file you can use the `--collate` flag.

Explicitly listed files must match `*.{fastq,fq,fasta,fa}[.gz|.zst]` (and `_R1`/`_R2` with `--paired`); others are skipped with a warning.
Note that exactly two input files are treated as a single R1/R2 pair, so a glob that happens to match two files encodes one paired file.

```bash
# encodes all FASTX files into separate BINSEQ files
bqtools encode /path/to/fastx/*.fastq.gz

# encodes all paired FASTX files into separated paired-BINSEQ files
bqtools encode /path/to/fastx/*.fastq.gz --paired

# encodes all FASTX files into a single BINSEQ file
bqtools encode /path/to/fastx/*.fastq.gz -o some.vbq --collate

# encodes all FASTX files into a single paired-BINSEQ file
bqtools encode /path/to/fastx/*.fastq.gz -o some.vbq --collate --paired

# encodes every file listed (one path per line) in a manifest
bqtools encode --manifest files.txt --paired
```

#### Recursive Encoding

You might have a directory or nested subdirectories with multiple FASTX files or FASTX file pairs.

`bqtools` makes use of the efficient [`walkdir`](https://crates.io/crates/walkdir) crate to recursively identify all FASTX files with various compression formats.
It will then balance the provided file/file pairs among the thread pool to ensure efficient parallel encoding.

All options provided by `bqtools encode` will be passed through to the sub-encoders.
The exceptions are `-o`, which only applies when there is a single output (e.g. with `--collate`), and `--pipe`, which is not supported for batch encoding.

```bash
# Encode all FASTX files as CBQ
bqtools encode --recursive --mode cbq ./

# Encode all paired FASTX files as VBQ
bqtools encode --recursive --paired --mode vbq ./

# Encode as BQ recursively with a max-subdirectory depth of 2
bqtools encode --recursive --mode bq --depth 2 ./
```

### Decoding

Convert BINSEQ files back to FASTA/FASTQ/TSV.
The format is inferred from the `-o` extension (or set with `-f`), and defaults to TSV when writing to stdout:

```bash
# Decode to FASTQ (format inferred from the extension)
bqtools decode input.bq -o output.fastq

# Decode to stdout as FASTQ (stdout defaults to TSV)
bqtools decode input.bq -f q

# Decode to compressed FASTQ (gzip/zstd)
bqtools decode input.bq -o output.fastq.gz
bqtools decode input.bq -o output.fastq.zst

# Decode to FASTA
bqtools decode input.bq -o output.fa -f a

# Decode paired-end reads into separate files
bqtools decode input.bq --prefix output -f q
# Creates output_R1.fq and output_R2.fq

# ... gzip-compressed
bqtools decode input.bq --prefix output -f q -c g
# Creates output_R1.fq.gz and output_R2.fq.gz

# Specify which read of a pair to output
bqtools decode input.bq -o output.fastq -m 1  # Only first read
bqtools decode input.bq -o output.fastq -m 2  # Only second read

# Only decode records 1000..2000 (0-based, end-exclusive)
bqtools decode input.bq -o output.fastq --span 1000..2000

# Set threads for parallel processing
bqtools decode input.bq -o output.fastq -T 4
```

### Concatenating

Combine multiple BINSEQ files:

```bash
bqtools cat file1.bq file2.bq file3.bq -o combined.bq
```

All inputs must be the same BINSEQ variant with identical headers (e.g. same bitsize and flags); the output inherits those settings.
For vbq/cbq, records are re-encoded in parallel, so record order is not preserved.

> Note: `cat`, `revcomp`, and other commands that write BINSEQ output require either `-o/--output`
> or an explicit `--pipe` flag; binary BINSEQ data is never written to stdout implicitly.

### Reverse Complementing

Reverse complement the sequences in a BINSEQ file, preserving its format and configuration
(so the output extension must match the input's). Record order is not preserved:

```bash
bqtools revcomp input.cbq -o output.cbq
```

For paired files, both mates are reverse complemented by default. Use `-M/--mate` to
reverse complement only one of the two mates (the other is left untouched):

```bash
# Only reverse complement mate 1
bqtools revcomp input.cbq -o output.cbq -M 1

# Only reverse complement mate 2
bqtools revcomp input.cbq -o output.cbq -M 2
```

### Information and Statistics

Show information and statistics about one or more BINSEQ files.

```bash
bqtools info input.cbq

# print only the record count of each file ("<count>\t<path>")
bqtools info *.cbq --num

# print out the block index (VBQ/CBQ)
bqtools info input.vbq --show-index

# print out the CBQ block headers (CBQ only)
bqtools info input.cbq --show-headers

# export as json
bqtools info input.cbq --json
```

> Note: the default tabular output formats the number of records with underscores to delimit the thousands.
> To pass raw numerical values forward use `--num` or `--json`.

### Verify

Compute a checksum over a BINSEQ file to confirm its contents. Because BINSEQ files are
frequently produced by parallel encoders, record order is not guaranteed to match the input
FASTQ/FASTA. `verify` accounts for this by hashing each record independently (with `xxh3-64`)
and combining the per-record hashes with a commutative operation (wrapping sum), so the
resulting checksum is identical regardless of record order.

```bash
bqtools verify input.cbq
```

This prints a tab-separated `<checksum>\t<num_records>\t<path>` (a 16-hex-digit checksum), so two
files can be confirmed to carry the same data - even if a parallel encoder wrote them in different
record orders - by comparing checksums:

```bash
bqtools verify original.cbq
bqtools verify reencoded.cbq
```

Two encodes of the same input only match if the encoding is deterministic: bq/vbq replace `N`
with a random base under the default policy (use `-p a` when encoding), and bq never stores
headers. `--span` selects records by file position, so a span is not order-independent.

By default the checksum covers sequence, quality, headers, and the record flag. Headers are
automatically excluded (with a warning) for files that don't store them, such as all bq files,
and files written by `bqtools encode` carry no record flags. Use the
`--skip-*` flags to exclude fields you don't care about (e.g. to ignore header differences
introduced by a re-encode):

```bash
bqtools verify input.cbq --skip-headers
bqtools verify input.cbq --skip-qual --skip-flags
```

For paired files, both mates are included by default. Use `-M/--mate` to restrict the checksum
to a single mate:

```bash
bqtools verify input.cbq -M 1
```

`-M 2` errors on single-end files. Other options include `--skip-seq`, `--span`, and `-T/--threads`
(see `bqtools verify --help`).

Export the checksum report (including the field list, mate, and algorithm) as JSON with `--json`:

```bash
bqtools verify input.cbq --json
```

> Note: `verify`'s checksum is a fast integrity/reorder check (via `xxh3-64`), not a
> cryptographic digest - it is not designed to detect deliberate tampering.

### Grep

You can easily search for specific subsequences or regular expressions within BINSEQ files:

By default the multiple pattern logic is AND (i.e. all patterns must match).
The logic can be changed to OR (i.e. any pattern must match) with the `--or-logic` option.

Matching records are written to stdout as TSV by default (colorized when writing to a terminal; see `--color`),
or in the format inferred from `-o`. For paired files, `-m 1`/`-m 2` restricts both the output and all patterns to that mate.

```bash
# See full options list
bqtools grep --help

# Search for a specific regex in either sequence
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGT[AC]TCCA"

# Search for a specific subsequence (in primary sequence)
bqtools grep input.bq -r "ATCG"

# Search for a regular expression (in extended)
bqtools grep input.bq -R "AT[CG]"

# Search for multiple regular expressions in either
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGT[AG]TCCA" "AG(TTTT|CCCC)A"

# Search for multiple regular expressions (OR-logic)
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGT[AG]TCCA" "AG(TTTT|CCCC)A" --or-logic

# Only search for patterns within a specified range per sequence (0-based, end-exclusive: bases 30..80)
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGT[AG]TCCA" --range 30..80

# Only search for patterns within a specified range per sequence (bases 0..80)
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGT[AG]TCCA" --range ..80

# Only search for patterns within a specified range per sequence (base 80 to the end)
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGT[AG]TCCA" --range 80..
```

Range bounds past the end of a sequence are clamped to its length.

Patterns can be reverse complemented before matching with `--rc`. This only supports fixed ACGT
patterns (from CLI arguments or pattern files) — regex patterns are rejected since reverse
complementing a regex is undefined.

```bash
# Search for the reverse complement of a fixed pattern
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGTACGT" --rc
```

Patterns can be matched against the record header instead of the sequence with `--header`/`-H`.
This conflicts with `--rc` (reverse complement is undefined for header text) and `--range`
(a coordinate range is meaningless against header text). Colorized output is also disabled in
this mode, since match positions would refer to the header rather than the sequence.

```bash
# Search for a substring in the header instead of the sequence
bqtools grep input.bq "sample_alpha" --header -x
```

`bqtools` also support fuzzy matching by making use of [`sassy`](https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/sassy).

This requires installing using the `fuzzy` feature flag (see installation above).

Unlike the regex and Aho-Corasick backends, fuzzy matching requires all patterns
within a given pattern set (primary/secondary/either) to have the same length —
this is a `sassy` requirement. Mismatched lengths are rejected with an error
rather than a crash.

```bash
# Run grep with fuzzy matching (-z)
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGTACGT" -z

# Run fuzzy matching with an edit distance of 2
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGTACGT" -z -k2

# Run fuzzy matching but ignore exact (0-edit) hits
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGTACGT" -zi
```

Fuzzy matching also filters out matches with too many ambiguous `N` bases, controlled by `--max-n-frac`.
By default this is `k / pattern_length` (computed separately for each of the primary/secondary/either pattern sets), but it can be set explicitly:

```bash
# Reject any match containing an N
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGTACGT" -z --max-n-frac 0.0

# Disable the N-fraction filter entirely
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGTACGT" -z --max-n-frac 1.0
```

`bqtools` can also handle a large collection of patterns which can be provided on the CLI as a file.
Pattern files can be **plain text** (one pattern per line), **FASTA** (sequences are used as patterns), or **TSV** (two columns: alias and pattern). The format is auto-detected.
For FASTA and TSV files the header/alias is used as the pattern name in output; plain text patterns use the pattern string itself.
You can provide files for either primary/extended, just primary, or just extended patterns with the relevant flags.
Notably this will match _solely_ with OR logic.
This can be used also with fuzzy matching as well as with pattern counting described below.
Regex is also fully supported and files can be additionally paired with CLI arguments.

Patterns that are all uppercase `ACGT` are automatically matched with the more efficient [Aho-Corasick algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm).
For other literal patterns (e.g. lowercase or header text) use the `-x/--fixed` flag. `-x` is ignored under the default AND logic with multiple CLI patterns.

```bash
# Run grep with patterns from a plain text file (one pattern per line)
bqtools grep input.bq --file patterns.txt

# Run grep with patterns from a FASTA file (sequences used as patterns)
bqtools grep input.bq --file patterns.fa

# Run grep with patterns from a file (primary)
bqtools grep input.bq --sfile patterns.txt

# Run grep with patterns from a file (extended)
bqtools grep input.bq --xfile patterns.txt

# Run grep with fixed-string patterns from a file
bqtools grep input.bq --file patterns.txt -x
```

You can count the number of matching records with `-C` or get the fraction of matching records with `--frac`:

```bash
# Count the number of matching records
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGTACGT" -C

# Count matching records and show fraction of total
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGTACGT" -F
```

The output of `--frac` is a TSV with three columns: [Count, Total, Fraction]
Counting modes (`-C`, `-F`, `-P`) never write records, so they can't be combined with `-o`/`-p`.

`bqtools` also introduces a new feature for the counting the occurrences of individual patterns.
This is useful for seeing how many times each pattern occurs across a sequencing dataset without having to iterate over the dataset multiple times using traditional methods.

Some important notes are:

1. A pattern will only be counted once across a sequencing record (primary and secondary)
2. A sequencing record may contribute to multiple patterns occurrences
3. Providing multiple patterns will match records with `OR` logic (this is different behavior from `bqtools grep` default which uses `AND` logic when multiple patterns are provided)
4. Regular expressions are supported and treated as a single pattern (e.g. `ACGT|TCGA` will return a single output row but match on both `ACGT` and `TCGA`).
5. Invert is supported for counting patterns and will return the number of records a pattern does not occur in.
6. `--header` is supported and counts matches against the record header instead of the sequence.

As with matching, uppercase `ACGT` patterns automatically use Aho-Corasick, and `-x/--fixed` forces it for other literal patterns.

The throughput gains for this can be massive for pattern counting, especially when dealing with high numbers of patterns.

```bash
# Count the number of occurrences for each of three expressions
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGTACGT" "TCGATCGA$" "AAA(TT|CC)AAA" -P

# Count the number of occurrences for each of three patterns with fuzzy matching
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGTACGT" "TCGATCGA" "AAAAAAAA" -Pz

# Count the number of records a pattern does not occur in
bqtools grep input.bq "ACGTACGT" "TCGATCGA" "AAAAAAAA" -Pv

# Count the number of occurrences for each pattern from a file
bqtools grep input.bq --file patterns.txt -P

# Count the number of occurrences for each pattern from a file (fixed strings)
bqtools grep input.bq --file patterns.txt -Px
```

The output of pattern count is a TSV with three columns: [Name, Count, Fraction of Total].
When patterns are loaded from a FASTA or TSV file, the header/alias is used as the name; otherwise, the pattern string itself is used.

```bash
# Count patterns from a FASTA file (names column shows FASTA headers)
bqtools grep input.bq --file patterns.fa -P
```

### Sample

Randomly subsample a BINSEQ file. Each record is kept independently with probability `-F`, so the
output size is approximate. The same `-S/--seed` selects the same records regardless of thread count.
Output options are the same as `decode` (TSV on stdout by default).

```bash
# Keep ~10% of reads
bqtools sample input.cbq -F 0.1 -o subset.fastq.gz

# Reproducible subsample with a fixed seed
bqtools sample input.cbq -F 0.1 -S 7 -o subset.fq

# Paired input into separate R1/R2 files (subset_R1.fq / subset_R2.fq)
bqtools sample input.cbq -F 0.5 --prefix subset -f q
```

### Split

Split a BINSEQ file into separate files based on which pattern each record matches.

Patterns are provided through the same pattern files as `grep` (plain text, FASTA, or TSV with alias/sequence).
Each output file is named after the pattern alias, and records matching no pattern are written to an `unmatched` file.
A record is only written when it matches exactly one alias; ambiguous records (matching multiple aliases) are treated as unmatched.

Like `grep`, the backend is auto-selected: fixed-string patterns use Aho-Corasick (or force with `-x/--fixed`), regex patterns use the regex backend, and `-z/--fuzzy` enables fuzzy matching (requires the `fuzzy` feature flag).

Outputs are written to `./split_outs` by default and keep the input's BINSEQ mode.
The unmatched file can be renamed with `--unmatched-basename`, and `--span` restricts splitting to a range of records.

Like `grep`, patterns can be reverse complemented before matching with `--rc`. This only supports
fixed ACGT patterns — regex patterns are rejected since reverse complementing a regex is undefined.
The output alias reflects the reverse-complemented sequence.

```bash
# See full options list
bqtools split --help

# Split into per-pattern files (named by FASTA header / TSV alias)
bqtools split input.cbq --file patterns.tsv

# Write outputs to a specific directory
bqtools split input.cbq --file patterns.tsv --basepath ./by_sample

# Split on primary or extended sequence patterns
bqtools split input.cbq --sfile primary.fa
bqtools split input.cbq --xfile extended.fa

# Force fixed-string (Aho-Corasick) matching
bqtools split input.cbq --file patterns.tsv -x

# Split with fuzzy matching (edit distance of 2; requires -F fuzzy)
bqtools split input.cbq --file patterns.fa -z -k2

# Skip writing the unmatched file
bqtools split input.cbq --file patterns.tsv --skip-unmatched

# Split using the reverse complement of the provided patterns
bqtools split input.cbq --file patterns.tsv --rc
```

Output files with fewer than a minimum number of records are removed (defaults to 1, dropping empty files).
Use `--min-records N` to raise the threshold, or `--min-records 0` to keep all files.

```bash
# Only keep output files with at least 100 records
bqtools split input.cbq --file patterns.tsv --min-records 100

# Keep all output files, including empty ones
bqtools split input.cbq --file patterns.tsv --min-records 0
```

### Pipe

Stream BINSEQ data to legacy tools through named pipes for parallel processing.

Because BINSEQ is a new format, many tools don't support it yet.
`bqtools pipe` creates a server that splits a BINSEQ file into multiple named pipes,
enabling parallel processing with tools that expect FASTQ/FASTA files.

Importantly, if your tool supports multiple parallel threads (i.e. parallelizes input files), you can make use of this feature to significantly improve performance.

`-p` counts FIFOs: single-end input gets `p` pipes, while paired input gets `p/2` R1/R2 pairs.
It defaults to the CPU count and is capped at it. FIFOs are written as FASTQ unless `-f a` is given.

```bash
# Create 4 named pipes (4 FIFOs for single-end data, 2 R1/R2 pairs for paired-end data)
# Pipes (single): fifo_[0123].fq
# Pipes (paired): fifo_[01]_R[12].fq
bqtools pipe input.vbq -p 4 -b fifo &

# Process in parallel with tools that don't support BINSEQ (single-end)
ls fifo_*.fq | xargs -P 4 -I {} sh -c 'legacy-tool "$1" > "${1%.fq}.out"' _ {}
```

#### Executing commands automatically

Managing FIFOs by hand (backgrounding the server, globbing paths, cleaning up)
is error-prone. The `-x`/`--exec` and `-X`/`--exec-batch` flags let `bqtools pipe`
spawn the consumer processes for you, wire them up to the FIFOs, and wait for
them to finish before tearing everything down.

**`-x` / `--exec`** runs one shell command **per pipe**, substituting these tokens:

| Token  | Expands to                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `{}`   | the FIFO path (single-end)                        |
| `{R1}` | the R1 FIFO path (paired-end)                     |
| `{R2}` | the R2 FIFO path (paired-end)                     |
| `{n}`  | the pipe index (`0`, `1`, …) for per-shard output |

```bash
# Single-end: one `legacy-tool` invocation per pipe, in parallel
bqtools pipe input.cbq -p 4 -x 'legacy-tool {} > shard_{n}.out'

# Paired-end: each invocation receives its own R1/R2 pair
bqtools pipe paired.cbq -p 4 -x 'legacy-tool --in1 {R1} --in2 {R2} -o out_{n}.bam'

# Process only one mate by referencing just {R1} (R2 FIFOs are never created)
bqtools pipe paired.cbq -p 4 -x 'legacy-tool {R1} > r1_{n}.out'
```

**`-X` / `--exec-batch`** runs a **single** command, substituting a space-joined
list of all FIFO paths. This suits tools that accept many input files as
positional arguments and parallelize internally.

```bash
# Single-end: all FIFO paths joined into one argument list
bqtools pipe input.cbq -p 4 -X 'legacy-tool {} > merged.out'

# Paired-end: {R1} and {R2} each expand to their full list
bqtools pipe paired.cbq -p 4 -X 'legacy-tool --in1 {R1} --in2 {R2}'
```

In batch mode, writing `{R1} {R2}` **adjacent** in the template interleaves the
paths as pairs (`r1_0 r2_0 r1_1 r2_1 …`) so positional-argument tools receive
each pair together. When the tokens appear separately, each expands to its own
contiguous list.

Notes:

- `-x` and `-X` are mutually exclusive.
- The template is validated up front (`{}` for single-end, at least one of
  `{R1}`/`{R2}` for paired-end) so a malformed template fails fast instead of
  leaving an unread FIFO open.
- `bqtools pipe` exits non-zero if any spawned command exits non-zero.
- `{n}` only applies to `-x`; it has no meaning in `-X` (a single invocation).
- Commands run via `sh -c`.

**Key features:**

- Each pipe streams a portion of the BINSEQ file **sequentially**
- No disk I/O for intermediate files - data flows through memory
- Automatic paired-end handling (`_R1`/`_R2` pairs)
- Optionally spawn and supervise consumer commands with `-x` / `-X`
- Blocks until all pipes are fully read (prevents data loss)
- Auto-scales to CPU count with `-p0` (default)
- Pipes can be read sequentially _or_ in parallel without blocking.

> Note: This feature is not available on Windows.

### QC

Run [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/fastqc)-inspired quality control on a BINSEQ file and write a Markdown
summary report plus per-module TSV files to an output directory.

```bash
# Run all QC modules with default settings
bqtools qc input.cbq

# Write results to a specific directory (default: ./bqtools-qc)
bqtools qc input.cbq -o qc-results

# Only QC a span of records
bqtools qc input.cbq --span 0..100000

# Skip specific modules
bqtools qc input.cbq --skip-dup-levels --skip-overrepresented

# Set the number of leading records (of the span) sampled for duplication-level
# and overrepresented-sequence estimation (0 uses all records)
bqtools qc input.cbq --dup-sample-size 50000

# Set the minimum percentage (0-100) of sampled reads a sequence must represent
# to be flagged as overrepresented (default 0.1, i.e. 0.1%)
bqtools qc input.cbq --overrepresented-threshold 0.5

# Set threads for parallel processing
bqtools qc input.cbq -T 8
```

Modules (each toggled off independently with a `--skip-*` flag):

- Per-base sequence quality (`--skip-base-qual`)
- Per-sequence quality (`--skip-seq-qual`)
- Per-base sequence content (`--skip-base-content`)
- Per-sequence GC content (`--skip-seq-gc`)
- Sequence length distribution (`--skip-seq-length`)
- Sequence duplication levels (`--skip-dup-levels`)
- Overrepresented sequences (`--skip-overrepresented`)

Output directory contents:

- `summary.md` — overview table (input path, record count, and paired flag) and a
  headline section per enabled module
- `base_quality_R1.tsv` / `base_quality_R2.tsv`
- `seq_quality_R1.tsv` / `seq_quality_R2.tsv`
- `base_content_R1.tsv` / `base_content_R2.tsv`
- `gc_content_R1.tsv` / `gc_content_R2.tsv`
- `seq_length_R1.tsv` / `seq_length_R2.tsv`
- `duplication_levels_R1.tsv` / `duplication_levels_R2.tsv`
- `overrepresented_sequences_R1.tsv` / `overrepresented_sequences_R2.tsv` (only written if any
  sequence meets the threshold)

For paired-end input, each module writes separate `_R1`/`_R2` files and the
summary report splits its section into `### R1`/`### R2` subsections;
single-end input only produces the `_R1` files and an unsplit section.
